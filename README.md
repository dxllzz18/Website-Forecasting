Website Traffic Forecasting
Overview
This project implements advanced time series forecasting techniques to predict website traffic patterns across multiple domains. By leveraging historical visitor data, seasonal trends, and external factors such as marketing campaigns and social media activity, our model delivers accurate short and long-term traffic projections. The primary focus is on ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models with supplementary deep learning approaches to handle complex non-linear patterns when necessary.
Features

Time Series Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of temporal patterns, seasonal effects, and trend components in website traffic data
Multi-model Approach: Primary ARIMA modeling with supplementary LSTM neural networks for capturing complex non-linear patterns
Feature Engineering: Incorporation of temporal features, user behavior metrics, and external factors affecting website traffic
Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards to visualize historical traffic patterns and forecasted predictions
Performance Metrics: Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and other relevant time series metrics

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations
Statsmodels: Implementation of ARIMA, SARIMA, and statistical analysis
TensorFlow/Keras: Implementation of LSTM neural networks (supplementary models)

Scikit-learn: Feature preprocessing and model evaluation

Methodology

Data Collection: Gathered historical website traffic data from multiple sources
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and standardized formats
Exploratory Analysis: Identified patterns, seasonality, and potential influencing factors
Feature Engineering: Created time-based features and incorporated external variables
Model Development:

Primary: ARIMA/SARIMA models for baseline forecasting
Secondary: LSTM networks for capturing complex patterns


Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters using grid search and cross-validation
Model Evaluation: Assessed performance on holdout data using multiple metrics
Deployment: Created forecasting pipeline for ongoing traffic predictions

Results
Our ARIMA-based approach achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of [X]% on test data, outperforming standard baseline models by [Y]%. The model successfully captured weekly and monthly seasonal patterns, as well as special event effects like marketing campaigns and holidays. Integration with supplementary LSTM models improved predictions during highly irregular traffic periods by an additional [Z]%.
Future Work

Incorporate real-time data streams for continuous model updating
Expand feature set to include more external factors (e.g., competitor traffic, market trends)
Develop anomaly detection capabilities to identify unusual traffic patterns
Create automated reporting system for stakeholders
